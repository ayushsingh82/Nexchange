# NeXchange: Lean Canvas

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**Current Pain Points:**
- Users need **multiple wallets** to interact with different blockchains
- **Managing different private keys** across chains is complex and risky
- **No seamless way** to stake on multiple chains from a single interface
- **Bridging assets** between chains is expensive and time-consuming
- **Fragmented DeFi experience** across different ecosystems

**Core Problem:** To stake on different chains, users currently need different wallets and must handle multiple private keys, creating friction and security risks.

## 💡 **Solution**

**NeXchange: Intent-Based Cross-Chain DeFi Protocol**

**Key Components:**
1. **NEAR Wallet Integration** - Single wallet for all cross-chain operations
2. **Intent-Based Architecture** - Users express what they want, not how to do it
3. **Cross-Chain Signatures** - Secure authentication across all supported chains
4. **Integrated Staking Pools** - Direct access to Solana, NEAR, and EVM staking
5. **Automated Cross-Chain Execution** - Seamless asset movement and operations

**How It Works:**
- Users connect their **NEAR wallet** once
- **Intents** automatically handle getting tokens to the desired chain
- **Cross-chain signatures** enable direct staking without bridging
- **Integrated pools** provide access to best yields across chains
