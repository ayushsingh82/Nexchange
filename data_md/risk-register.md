# Risk Register - NeXchange

This document highlights the key risks for the NeXchange cross-chain intent execution protocol and how we plan to manage them.

## Key Risks

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **R-001** | **Cross-chain signature vulnerabilities** - Compromise of derived addresses or signature generation logic leading to unauthorized transactions | High | High | Use NEAR Chain Signatures MPC service, continuous security audits, multi-signature validation | Mitigated |
| **R-002** | **Intent execution failures** - Failed cross-chain transactions causing loss of funds or stuck assets | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, transaction monitoring, automatic retry mechanisms, fallback execution paths | Monitoring |
| **R-003** | **Smart contract bugs** - Vulnerabilities in intents contract or cross-chain integration logic | Medium | High | Code audits, formal verification, extensive testing, gradual rollout with limited funds | Monitoring |
| **R-004** | **External API dependencies** - 1Click API failures, RPC node outages, or data source inaccuracies | Medium | Medium | Multiple API providers, fallback mechanisms, real-time monitoring, circuit breakers | Monitoring |
| **R-005** | **Bridge and liquidity risks** - Insufficient liquidity for swaps, bridge exploits, or slippage beyond tolerance | Medium | Medium | Multiple liquidity sources, slippage protection, liquidity monitoring, emergency pause mechanisms | Monitoring |
| **R-006** | **Network congestion and gas spikes** - High transaction costs or failed transactions due to network issues | High | Medium | Dynamic gas estimation, priority fee management, network monitoring, user notifications | Mitigated |
| **R-007** | **User experience failures** - Complex interface leading to user errors and lost funds | Medium | Medium | Intuitive UI/UX design, extensive user testing, clear error messages, transaction previews | Monitoring |
| **R-008** | **Regulatory compliance** - Legal issues with cross-chain operations or staking services | Low | High | Legal consultation, compliance monitoring, geographic restrictions if needed, regulatory updates | Monitoring |
| **R-009** | **Frontend security** - Client-side vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, or malicious dApp interactions | Medium | Medium | Secure coding practices, CSP headers, wallet integration security, user education | Monitoring |
| **R-010** | **Key management** - Compromise of NEAR wallet or derived address private keys | High | High | MPC-based signing, hardware wallet support, multi-factor authentication, key rotation | Resolved |
| **R-011** | **Economic attacks** - MEV attacks, sandwich attacks, or manipulation of cross-chain prices | Medium | Medium | MEV protection, private mempools, price validation, time-weighted pricing | Monitoring |
| **R-012** | **Scalability limitations** - System overload during high usage periods | Medium | Low | Horizontal scaling, caching strategies, load balancing, performance monitoring | Monitoring |

## Risk Rating Guide

### Likelihood:
- **Low** = unlikely to occur (< 20%)
- **Medium** = possible (20-60%)
- **High** = likely to occur (> 60%)

### Impact:
- **Low** = minor effect on cost/timeline/quality
- **Medium** = noticeable effect but manageable
- **High** = major delay, cost overrun, or failure risk

### Risk Rating (L×I):
Combine likelihood × impact:
- **Low × Low = 1** (Minimal Risk)
- **Medium × Low = 2** (Low Risk)
- **Low × Medium = 2** (Low Risk)
- **Medium × Medium = 4** (Medium Risk)
- **High × Low = 3** (Medium Risk)
- **Medium × High = 4** (Medium Risk)
- **Low × High = 3** (Medium Risk)
- **High × Medium = 6** (High Risk)
- **High × High = 9** (Critical Risk)

## Status Guide

- **Open** – Identified, not yet mitigated
- **Monitoring** – Being watched with actions in place
- **Mitigated** – Risk reduced through actions
- **Resolved** – No longer relevant

## Risk Monitoring & Response

### Critical Risks (Rating 9):
- **R-001**: Cross-chain signature vulnerabilities
- **R-003**: Smart contract bugs

### High Risks (Rating 6):
- **R-002**: Intent execution failures
- **R-010**: Key management

### Medium Risks (Rating 4):
- **R-004**: External API dependencies
- **R-005**: Bridge and liquidity risks

### Monitoring Schedule:
- **Weekly**: Critical and High risks
- **Monthly**: Medium risks
- **Quarterly**: Low risks and overall risk assessment

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Mitigations:
1. **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and stress testing
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time transaction and system monitoring
4. **Fallbacks**: Multiple execution paths and recovery mechanisms

### Operational Mitigations:
1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides and error handling
2. **Support**: 24/7 monitoring and user support
3. **Training**: Team training on risk management procedures
4. **Communication**: Clear user communication about risks and limitations

### Financial Mitigations:
1. **Insurance**: Protocol insurance for critical failures
2. **Reserves**: Emergency fund for compensation
3. **Limits**: Gradual rollout with transaction limits
4. **Transparency**: Public reporting of risk metrics
