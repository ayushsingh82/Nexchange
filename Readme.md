# 🔀 NeXchange

**NeXchange** is a decentralized, intent-based cross-chain execution protocol that allows users to stake NEAR , SOL , ETH ..etc  to their respective staking pools like Jito for Solana , Ethfi for ETH  and beyond — directly from their **NEAR wallet**. No bridging, no wallet switching, no friction.

Built as a **public good** for the NEAR ecosystem, NeXchange empowers real users and developers with seamless, AI-optimized, and verifiable cross-chain functionality.

## 🌍 What is NeXchange?

NeXchange enables NEAR users to:

- ✅ Swap NEAR → SOL / ETH / USDC and more via AI-optimized execution
- ✅ Stake directly on Solana staking pool or EVM staking pools and near staking pools from your NEAR wallet
- ✅ Use one wallet (NEAR) to interact across multiple ecosystems
- ✅ Automate treasury and DAO operations with verifiable results (coming soon)
- ✅ Execute DeFi actions (lend, borrow, yield farm) across chains  ( coming soon )

All actions are powered by signed **intents**, which are interpreted and executed by a decentralized network of **solver nodes**.

## 🧱 Why It Matters

NeXchange is designed as a **modular, open-source public good** that prioritizes:

- 🔓 **Transparency** – Fully auditable on-chain execution
- 🔁 **Interoperability** – Seamless NEAR ↔ Solana / EVM integration
- ⚙️ **Modularity** – Built to be extended and forked by the community
- 👤 **User Experience** – Zero need to switch wallets or manage gas across chains

---

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Intent Creation**  
   A user signs an intent from their NEAR wallet (e.g., "swapping SOL on NEAR to SOL on SOL ").

2. **AI Optimization**  
   The NeXchange AI interprets the intent, finds the best path, and ensures execution safety.

3. **Broadcast to Solvers**  
   The execution request is broadcast to a decentralized network of solver nodes.

4. **Execution & Verification**  
   The best solver executes the transaction on Solana or EVM and provides verifiable proof.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **NEAR-First UX**  
  All cross-chain interactions begin from NEAR. No more wallet chaos.

- **Intent-Based Execution**  
  Simple signed messages using chain signature to sign transaction cross chain unlock powerful cross-chain actions.

- **AI-Powered Routing**  
  Get the best price, speed, and reliability without needing to choose.

- **Non-Custodial & Secure**  
  No bridges. No wrapped tokens. No central intermediaries.

## 💡 Real-World Impact

- 🧾 **Stake** on Solana or EVM platforms directly from NEAR.
- 🔄 **Swap** assets (e.g., NEAR → ETH, USDC → SOL) via a single click.
- 🧠 **Use DeFi** apps across ecosystems without leaving the NEAR environment.
- 🛠 **Builders** can offer cross-chain functionality natively inside NEAR dApps.
- 🏛 **DAOs** can manage multi-chain treasuries via intent-based automation.
