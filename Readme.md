1. Intent-based Walletless Token Swap
Problem: Users don’t know what tokens they need to swap.

Idea: A UI where a user says, “I want $10 in USDC,” and the backend uses intents to route from any asset they hold (e.g., wNEAR, ETH, etc.) to USDC.

Tech: NEAR Intents + Meta Transactions + Chain Signatures.

2. Subscription Service via Intents
Let users subscribe to a service (e.g., AI, News, Games) by just approving an intent like “Subscribe monthly at $5”—behind the scenes, it auto-converts and transfers from any chain


3. Multichain DeFi Aggregator
Show users the best yield opportunities regardless of chain.

Use NEAR to sign and execute meta-transactions across networks.

4.  Cross-chain Assistant Agent
Users type: “Send 0.1 BTC to my NEAR wallet as USDC.”

Agent handles routing, bridging, signing, and confirming.
