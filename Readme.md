# 🔀 NeXchange

**NeXchange** is an intent-based cross-chain execution framework that enables users on NEAR to sign messages ("intents") which are executed on Solana / EVM by decentralized solver nodes. This allows seamless, non-custodial interactions between NEAR and Solana /EVM — such as swaps, transfers, NFT mints, and more — without requiring users to switch wallets or bridge assets.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intent-Based Architecture**: Users express their desired outcomes through signed messages, rather than executing complex cross-chain transactions directly
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Seamlessly connects NEAR with Solana and EVM-compatible chains
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain full control of their assets throughout the entire process
- **Decentralized Execution**: Powered by a network of solver nodes that compete to fulfill user intents
- **No Wallet Switching**: Users can interact with multiple chains using their NEAR wallet

## 💡 Use Cases

- Cross-chain token swaps
- NFT minting and transfers
- Asset bridging without traditional bridges
- Cross-chain DeFi operations
- Multi-chain portfolio management

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Users sign an intent message on NEAR expressing their desired cross-chain action
2. The intent is broadcast to the network of solver nodes
3. Solvers compete to fulfill the intent on the target chain (Solana/EVM)
4. Once executed, the result is verified and confirmed back to the user

## 🛡️ Security & Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: No need for traditional bridges or wrapped assets
- **Better UX**: Simplified user experience with single-wallet interaction
- **Cost-Effective**: Optimized execution through competitive solver network
- **Transparent**: All operations are verifiable on-chain
- **Extensible**: Framework can be extended to support additional chains and use cases
