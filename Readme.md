# ðŸ”€ NeXchange

**NeXchange** is an intent-based cross-chain execution framework that enables users on NEAR to sign messages ("intents") which are executed on Solana by decentralized solver nodes. This allows seamless, non-custodial interactions between NEAR and Solana â€” such as swaps, transfers, NFT mints, and more â€” without requiring users to switch wallets or bridge assets.
